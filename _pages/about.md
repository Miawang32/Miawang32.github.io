I am Mingshuo Wang, a graduate student at [USC](https://www.usc.edu/), double majoring in Petroleum Engineering and Engineering Management. My background in chemical engineering and experience in subsurface modeling, clean energy research, and oilfield analysis allow me to bridge technical expertise with practical applications. Currently involved in an ARPA-E project at GEM-Lab, focusing on hydrogen recovery and reservoir simulation using COMSOL. Previously interned at KEM Power, KEM Energy, and SINOPEC, with hands-on experience in project management and chemical analysis. Proficient in COMSOL, MATLAB, Python, and CAD.
